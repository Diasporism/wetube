Turntable.fm is pretty cool, but looking at those little characters is boring. Let’s build a collaborative music listening & watching service where I can:

* Create or join a room with friends
* We can watch music videos together
* Add music videos to a queue
* Have a chat room where we can discuss the music / video while it’s playing
* Get a message in the room when a video begins
* "Favorite" videos, creating a list I can replay later
